# PointCLM-tutorials
This is a repository to share workflows, analyses and more for people getting started using the Community Land Model (CLM)

To get started you can:
1. Fork this repository, this will give you your own copy of the repo on github.
2. Clone your fork locally on derecho (or another system)
```
  cd ~
  git clone --origin origin https://github.com/{$USER}/PointCLM-tutorials.git PointCLM-tutorials
  cd PointCLM-tutorials
```
  - you'll replace _$USER_ with your own github user name
  - this will clone your remote repository as the 'origin' with the same name on derecho
